# PROGRAMMING 741 C#


// Create a C# console application with the following guidelines.
//Context: The application that you will be creating will allow the users to enter their various Motor 
//Vehicle arrangements(to buy or hire) and have their expenses calculated.
//The program should complete the following objectives.
//The application must first obtain the users monthly gross income. And then their monthly tax 
//deductions by subtracting the 2 then you will get the users net income. Next the application must 
//gather the users expenditures for the motor vehicle: fuel, insurance, parking fees and maintenance 
//costs, all of the expenses needs to be stored in an array.
//Once the program has collected the above information from the user, the user needs to choose 
//between buying or hiring a Motor Vehicle. If the user chooses hiring the program should ask the user 
//for hiring cost per month, the program should display the users gross income, the net income and the 
//amount left after all expenses are paid in this case hiring is also an expense
//If the user chooses to buy the motor vehicle(assuming they obtained a loan from the bank) they need 
//to enter the following information(purchase price of the motor vehicle, total deposit, interest rate in 
//percentage, number of months to repay between 120 and 240 months) the application should then 
//calculate the monthly motor vehicle loan repayment on the motor vehicle based on the values the user 
//entered. If the motor vehicle loan is more than a third of the user gross income the program should 
//prompt the user approval is unlikely.
//The application should display the userâ€™s gross income, the net income and the amount left after all 
//expenses are paid in this case the motor vehicle loan is part of the expenses. Create an abstract class 
//expense from which motor vehicle loan etc can be derived. Store expenses in an array
